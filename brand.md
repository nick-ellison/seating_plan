4\. Visual Identity (Logo Pending)
----------------------------------

### Design Principles

The visual identity must reflect ArrangeIQ’s balance of intelligence (technical) and clarity (approachable design):

*   **Minimalist** — Clean lines, uncluttered layouts.
    
*   **Geometric** — Precise forms echo optimisation and structure.
    
*   **Modern** — A premium SaaS aesthetic.
    
*   **Human-centric** — Warm accents and approachable shapes.
    

### Logo Direction (to inform final design)

Logomark should explore one or more of the following ideas:

*   Stylised **A** or **IQ** monogram.
    
*   Circular seating grid representing tables.
    
*   Node-and-edge structures symbolising optimisation.
    
*   Abstract arrangement/lattice patterns.
    

The final design should work in monochrome, small sizes, and square icon formats.

5\. Colour Palette (Draft)
--------------------------

### Primary Palette

*   **Midnight Blue** — Trust, intelligence, depth
    
*   **Teal/Aqua Accent** — Modern algorithmic clarity
    
*   **Light Neutrals** — Spacious, calm interface
    
*   **Pure White** — Clean contrast for UI readability
    

### Secondary Palette

*   Slate greys for typography
    
*   Soft greens or indigos for call-to-action elements
    
*   Minimal use of saturated colours to maintain calm professionalism
    

6\. Typography
--------------

### Primary Typeface

**Inter** — Modern, balanced, highly legible for both UI and marketing content.

### Secondary Typeface (Optional)

A display font such as **Clash Display** or **Satoshi** may be used sparingly for hero headings or brand statements.

Typography should reinforce clarity, structure, and intelligence. Avoid overly decorative or playful fonts.

7\. UI Design Principles
------------------------

*   **Structure and spacing** — Generous whitespace and logical grouping.
    
*   **Soft geometry** — Light rounding (6–12px) and clean lines.
    
*   **Subtle depth** — Minimal shadows, gentle elevation.
    
*   **Meaningful colour** — Accents convey importance, not decoration.
    
*   **Visualised intelligence** — Seating diagrams, adjacency visuals, metrics panels.
    

The interface should feel simultaneously powerful and reassuring, supporting planners who juggle complex constraints.
